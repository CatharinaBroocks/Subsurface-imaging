# Subsurface Imaging
Repository for the Contribution to the Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon 2021
## Motivation
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. To still reach the 1.5Â° target, all scientists must join forces and ask themselves how they can contribute with their research.
That is exactly what we have done. To slow down climate change, carbon capturing, and storage methods will gain in importance in the future. CCS refers to the storage of CO2 in the seabed so that it does not reach the atmosphere. Renewable energies also require large quantities of rare metals. To meet this demand, deep-sea mining, the extraction of these metals from the seabed, has recently become a topic of discussion.
To realize these projects, meaningful models of the seabed are important, but subsurface modelling is an NP hard problem. Quantum computers could help to improve these calculations, as classical computers have reached their limits with the simulations.
## State of the art
- subsurface imagining is an NP hard problem
- current methods to solve it: Nature inspired global solvers [Pierini et al., 2019]
    - Firefly Algorithm
    - Whale Swarm Optimization
- Simulated Annealing [Rothman, 1985]
- method in research: Quantum Annealing
## What we do
We want to implement an equivalent gate-based solution in Qiskit. Using as a basis the research, which has been done on solving this problem by using Quantum Annealing.
## What we did
- Implemented the 1D problems in Qiskit
- 
## Next Steps
